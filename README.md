# Advent for Friends
A cute Advent Calendar toy hosted on [GitHub](tfavazza.github.io/advent-for-friends). Start date is hard coded for 2020, and `AdventJSON.js` could (should) probably be replaced with a real backend, but hey, it works.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
